I have 2 projects with makefile:

*** 1. Helloworld
- It is a very simple project with C 
- I wrote it simplely to learn about how to write a Makefile

*** 2. Endian_Test
- After I understand about Makefile, how to create hex/bin/elf files,
  I can write a Makefile for MCU 
- I used a project from previous report (Bare-metal Embedded) and 
  try write a makefile according to what I have learned

*** I deleted ouput file in those project because outlook does not allow sending exe file
